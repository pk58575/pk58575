# About Me

Hi, I'm **Prashant Kumar**. I am an Information Technology undergraduate student at Veer Madho Singh Bhandari Uttarakhand Technical University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand.

I have interned with Edunet Foundation and worked on few projects. 

What I might lack in experience, I make up for with my determination to learn.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing chess.
